# Informed-Searches-AI-Pathfinding-Visualizer
Interactive pathfinding visualization using Greedy Best First Search and A* Search algorithms built with Python Tkinter. Features animated grid traversal, heuristic-based search, dynamic runtime hurdles, and adjustable cell costs for demonstrating AI search techniques.


# How to Run

Open the file Question6.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code.
Run all the cells one by one.
You’ll see a grid where the algorithm moves step by step toward the goal.
Used Libraries
• tkinter to shows the grid animation • collections to handles queues/stacks for algorithms • matplotlib and numpy to used for grid display (if needed) • time to controls animation speed

# Install Libraries

Before running the project, you need to install the required Python libraries. Open your terminal or VS Code terminal and run:

pip install matplotlib numpy tk

Note: tk is sometimes included by default with Python. If it’s already installed, the command will just skip it.

# Purpose

This project helps beginners understand how search algorithms work in a simple and visual way. It’s great for learning AI basics, pathfinding, or Operating Systems concepts. it also tells about how heuristic and consistent work for finding best path.
